<h2><b>
The startup is working at game development, metaverse, content creation, etc and for these we have to create immersive assets and environments. There aren't any games that specifically target the Indian scenario yet. Their story lines are foreign based and so they lack a taste of indigenous Indian environment. This is the initial issue we are focusing on. The metaverse is viewed as a multi trillion-dollar possibility in the future, and several major technology companies are investing extensively in it. We are foreseeing Metaverse to be built on gaming environment and using game engines. There are some trials to metaverse but none is close to real world experience and if Metaverse is said to be a futuristic social interaction platform than its experience should be near to real world experience for user satisfaction. We are working on building immersive environments and assets which can be used in Metaverse platforms and can provide experience close to real world.
